### Chapter 2: easy does it
 * before reading a chapter explore it from a bird's-eye view
 * focused and diffuse mode of thinking
 * common mistake: jumping into water before learning to swim
 * diffuse mode for approaching something new
 * we need both modes for effective learning

### Chapter 3: learning is creating
 * shifting from focused to diffuse happens by distraction
 * do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem
 * you are making progress with each mistake you catch when trying to solve a problem
 * keep your working sessions short
 * back and forth between focused-mode attention and diffuse-mode relaxation does the trick
 * working memory and long-term memory
 * spaced repetition to move information from working memory to long-term memory

### Chapter 4: chunking and avoiding illusions of competence
 * focus can help solving a problem, but also blocking you to see new solutions
 * chunks: bits of information connected by meaning
 * chunks are required for gaining expertise
 * chunking an idea doesn't require to remember all underlying details
 * worked out examples can help seeing key features and principles
 * steps to chunking: focus on the information, understand the basic idea, gaining context to see how and when to use it
 * self-testing and retrieval practice far more important than rereading
 * recall practice reveals holes in understanding
 * increase chunked mental library
 * practice makes permanent
 * practicing and recalling material is an effective way to learn
 * recall material while outside usual place of study
 * interleaving instead overlearning: helps learning when to use a method instead of only how
