### Chapter 2: easy does it
 * before reading a chapter explore it from a bird's-eye view
 * focused and diffuse mode of thinking
 * common mistake: jumping into water before learning to swim
 * diffuse mode for approaching something new
 * we need both modes for effective learning

### Chapter 3: learning is creating
 * shifting from focused to diffuse happens by distraction
 * do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem
 * you are making progress with each mistake you catch when trying to solve a problem
 * keep your working sessions short
 * back and forth between focused-mode attention and diffuse-mode relaxation does the trick
 * working memory and long-term memory
 * spaced repetition to move information from working memory to long-term memory
 * work focused in small doses
