* Typed Functional Programming

  * Advantages
  
    * Forces you to better structure your code because you need to align the types.
      The types system prevents you from just adding side effecting statements here and there.
      This also leads to smaller functions.

  * Aggregate: The idea behind aggregate is to enforce consistency and invariants.
    An aggregate is a place where invariants are enforced and act as a consistency boundary.

  * Simple questions:
  
    * Why wasn't this discovered during design, development, review, (automated or manual) testing, monitoring?
    * Why did it took so long to
      * isolate the problem?
      * discover the cause of the problem?
